        "In this tutorial, we will focus on internal structure of Keras LSTM layer in order to understand how many **learnable parameters** an LTSM layer has.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why do we **need** to care of calculating number of parameters in LSTM layer ***since*** we can easily get this number in the model summary report?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well there are several reasons:\n",
        "* First of all, to calculate the number of learnable parameters correctly, we need to **understand how LSTM is structured** and how **LSTM operates** ***in depth***. Thus, we will delve into LSTM gates and gate functions. We will gain precious insight about how LSTM handles ***time dependent*** or ***sequence*** input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Secondly, in ANN models, number of parameter is a really important metric for understanding the **model capacity** and **complexity**. We need to keep an eye on the number of parameters of each layer in the model to handle ***overfitting*** or ***underfitting*** situations. One way to prevent these situations is to **adjust the number of parameters** of each layer. We need to know how number of parameters actullay affects the performance of each layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to enhance your understanding of LSTM layer and learn how many learnable parameters it has please continue this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the way, I would like to mention that in [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrCxCxTFL2ytaDrDYrN4_eA) I have a dedicated playlist in English ([All About LSTM](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQflnv_s49v_i1OVqE0DENBk-QJt9THjE)) and in Turkish  ([LSTM Hakkında Herşey](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQflnv_s49v9rxWesjI1GVs8qfxwwHDR4)).
